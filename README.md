## Research Project - Thermal Transport in Thin Film

This Research studies is done to measure the thermal diffusivity, alpha of YBCO. The thesis has been uploaded for your reading. It entails the reasoning, method and process taken done to achieve its objectives

## A little bit of explanation of the files

test35 is the first step. Obtaining absorptivity, Beta of Aluminium. Thus the best fit of Aluminum heat transfer-simulation is the Beta that we choose.

test38 is the comparison of heat transfer between Aluminium and YBCO thin film.

test36 is the collection of heat simulation of YBCO with different alpha. The data is calculated and exported into an excel file. We have 5 different value of alpha (0.1-0.5). I did not make it a loop and manually change the input and export coordinate as it would over complicate the code. So thus the code is written like so.

test37 finally we plot the heat transfer-simulation with different alpha. We opt for the best fit line and its average is calculated.

data is just data directory where the excel file is kept.

## Running the code

should not be any problem. Just open the .m file and run it and should run just fine.

## English thesis

At the moment not yet done. You can make use of the malay one for now.
